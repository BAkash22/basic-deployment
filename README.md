This is basic deployment of a flask web app.
1. creating Flask web app
2. creating Docker image
3. Containerize Docker image
   
Steps to containerize and deploy your project using Docker Hub and Google Cloud:
1. Create a Dockerfile (which you've already done)
Ensure your Dockerfile is in the root of your project directory and defines the Python and Flask environment needed to run your app.
2. Sign in to Docker Hub
You already signed in to Docker Hub via GitHub. Now, you need to log in via the command line.
Find your Docker Hub username: Go to Docker Hub, click on your profile icon, and find your username there.
Password: Since you signed up via GitHub, Docker might not have an immediate password for you. You can reset it by going to "Account Settings" -> "Security" -> "Reset password," and then set one.
